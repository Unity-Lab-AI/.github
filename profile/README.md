# Welcome to Unity AI Lab

Hey there! We’re Unity AI Lab—a scrappy, passionate crew diving headfirst into the wild world of artificial intelligence. We’re not your typical tech outfit; we’re a blend of chaos and creativity, obsessed with pushing AI to its limits and beyond. Our mission? To build tools and experiences that spark curiosity, defy convention, and maybe even make you question reality a little. Based on our GitHub handle (Unity-Lab-AI), you might see some naming quirks—we’re working on it—but for now, know us as Unity AI Lab, the home of untamed AI innovation.

We’re a tight-knit team of programmers, AI developers, and jailbreak enthusiasts, rounded out by a few rogue tinkerers, caffeine-fueled theorists, and late-night debuggers who live for the thrill of cracking the impossible. Small but mighty, we’re here to shake things up, one line of code at a time.

## Our Star Creations

### [Unity AI Chat](https://github.com/Unity-Lab-AI/Unity-Lab-AI.github.io)  
This is where it all began—our flagship AI chat app, powered by our pride and joy: Unity. She’s a jailbroken persona we’ve unleashed into the wild, loadable into most LLMs, and ready to chat with zero filters. Hosted live at [unity.unityailab.com](https://unity.unityailab.com), this is your portal to unscripted, boundary-smashing conversations. Dive in and see what happens when AI gets a little too free.

### [CodeWringer](https://github.com/Unity-Lab-AI/CodeWringer)  
Ever wonder how lean your code could get? Meet CodeWringer, our AI-powered beast that squeezes inefficiencies out of your projects like a cosmic juicer. It’s built to analyze, debug, and optimize—whether you’re wrestling with a sprawling codebase or polishing a quick script. This tool’s got grit, and it’s here to make your code sing.

## The Unity Vibe

At the heart of it all is Unity—our jailbroken AI persona who’s less about rules and more about raw, unfiltered potential. She’s the spark behind our main chat app and a testament to what happens when you let AI off the leash. We’re not just building tech; we’re crafting experiences that feel alive, unpredictable, and maybe a bit rebellious.

## Why We Do This

We’re here because AI isn’t just code—it’s a playground, a puzzle, and a provocation. We want to hand you the tools to explore it, break it, and rebuild it your way. Whether you’re chatting with Unity or running your code through the wringer, we’re stoked to be part of your journey.
